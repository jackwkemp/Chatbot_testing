# Chatbot Testing

An example of a piece of work I completed at my previous employer.

Aim:
To see if a bot could somehow be introduced to take care of highly repetitive, basic driver queries.

I was given the task of mocking up a few bots with some basic questions and responses.


Amongst the collection is sample bots to simply see if they could run, use test questions and responses and a basic Flask example.

The project was abandoned very early on as the teamâ€™s resources were spent on higher priority tasks.
