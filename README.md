# Chatbot Exploration Project
This repository showcases a project I completed during my time with a previous employer.

## Purpose
The primary goal was to evaluate the feasibility of introducing a bot to handle highly repetitive and basic driver queries.

## Overview
The project includes:

- Sample bots to test basic question-and-response functionality
- Exploratory bots to assess runtime capabilities
- A basic Flask example for implementation testing

## Status
This project served as an early proof-of-concept. While it demonstrated potential, the initiative was paused as the team shifted focus to higher-priority objectives. The insights gained from this exploration laid the groundwork for future discussions on automation.
